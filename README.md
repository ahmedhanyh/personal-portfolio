# Personal Portfolio

This is not my actual personal portfolio, this is just a clone of a personal portfolio
given in a [TOP exercise](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-advanced-html-and-css-personal-portfolio).

The project is done as a way to exercise making responsive websites that work well and look nice on different
screen sizes, specifically, in this exercise, on desktops, tablets, and mobiles.
